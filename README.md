# stackly-app


Stackly is an app that allows businesses and contractors to communicate and collaborate with their clients in real time for services they are offering. 
For example, if a contractor is creating a website for their client, the pair meet on the stackly platform and can discuss services provided and indicate job progress. Primarily, the client can track their contractor's work and progress into the website as well as request features and ideas. The contractor can display their progress, answer client requests and provide updates on tasks completed and communicate concerns. 

It is not simply a project management platform, but primarily one where clients can track their project's progress and receive live updates about their project and features, responding to updates all while maintaining complete knowledge and control over their project. (Clients also receive notifs about updates by email)

Implementation: react + firebase
